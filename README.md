# pvc

This is a phase vocoder implementation written in Python. It can be used to time-stretch audio files. This program also implements independent pitch-shifting of audio in the frequency domain, with optional formant correction.

Dependencies: numpy, scipy, SoundFile

To use the JACK application you must also install tkinter and JACK-Client.

## Usage

Run the following command to view the available parameters:

```
python3 pvc.py --help
```

### JACK application

A basic JACK client is also implemented that can perform pitch shifting of audio in real time. It can be started using the following command:

```
python3 pvc_jack.py
```

You'll then need to connect the inputs and outputs up using QJackCtl (or an equivalent program) as with any other JACK application. To use the program under PipeWire, add ```pw-jack``` at the beginning of the above command (on Debian, you may need to install the pipewire-audio-client-libraries package).

## Limitations

Currently, this phase vocoder can create significant phase artifacts when pitch-shifting audio. A few alternate algorithms are provided that may be able to reduce this problem but so far I have not found a complete solution.
